The Bankist application is an application in which the user can make transactions, where information is sent to the database on which date and which transaction was made. In order for the user to be able to see his bank account, he must log in.

## Description

- This application contains two user accounts whose names are:<br>
  Name: js <br>Password: 1111<br>
  Name: jd<br> Password: 2222
  
- When we log in to any account, the first thing that starts is the timer, which counts down for two minutes, if we do nothing, where it will log out by itself.
- The application shows us how much and on which date we made a transaction on the account. We can sort transactions from largest to smallest or by default by date.
- We can send money from one account to another. If we write the amount to be transferred that is larger than the money we have, we will not be able to complete the transaction. Otherwise, by logging in to another account, we will see the gain in the amount we previously entered.
- By pressing the loan button, the user will receive the desired transaction if it matches all the requirements of the application.
- There is a possibility that if a person wants to delete an account, they can do so provided they enter the correct username and password. After that, if everything is entered correctly, the account is deleted.
- At the bottom of the application we have calculated all the gains together and all the losses together. In the upper right corner of the application there is a sum of all income.

- I made this project with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann in the JavaScript course: [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), where I later changed and adjusted the project to my liking.
- I used a large number of array methods in the app, that's why I improved my level of knowledge about working with arrays.
